**Ultimate Texas Holdem** for Python

Once you clone this repo, run the program by typing
python uth.py --table_min = x, --balance = y
where x is usually 5, balance can be anything you want, but try 1000 as a starting point.

:fireworks: Enjoy! This is still an incomplete project but I will be pushing updates over time. I am busy with school currently, but I'll do what I can to update this into an MVP as soon as I can.
